    "Not all of these data smells are detectable in code. You may have to ask people about the data. You may have to compare it to another dataset yourself. Does the agency that uses the data produce reports from the data? Does your analysis match those reports? That will expose wrongly derived data, or wrong units, or mistakes you made with inclusion or exclusion.\n",

    "But with several of these data smells, we can do them first, before we do anything else. First, let's look at **Wrong Type Of Data**. We can sniff that out by simply printing the table structure that Agate has discovered for us."
